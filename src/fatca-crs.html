            FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and OECD are known to be applicable to US and EU citizens
            respectively, created for financial information exchange for tax purposes. In 2014 CRS (Common Reporting
            Standard) was developed in response to G20 request and approved by the OECD Council to attain information
            from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an
            annual basis.

            The information required to be collected and reported to their tax authority is automatically transferred
            between the domicile jurisdiction and those other countries engaged into commitment. Designed to increase
            tax revenue, these rules are not applicable to foreign financial institutions (FFI), such as banks and
            funds. Euro Deniz IBU can become the good choice for the said purpose. Licensed with non-FATCA/CRS
            jurisdiction the exchange system allows us to guarantee our clients the confidentiality of sensitive
            information.
