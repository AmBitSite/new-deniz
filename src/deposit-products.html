                Fixed Deposit Account is an effective financial option, since it enables the customer to get a fixed
                interest rate at the end of the investment period. Such type of the account has higher interest rate
                compared to usual savings account. In return to the proposed privileges customer is obliged not to
                withdraw the money till the end of the investment period.
            </span>
            <span class="block-info__text mb-10">
                A Fixed Deposit implies guaranteed returns. Unlike commercial investments where returns vacillate over
                the time, the returns on a Fixed Deposit are settled when you open the account. Even if interest rates
                fall after you open a Fixed Deposit, you will continue to receive the interest determined at the start.
                Fixed Deposits are considered much safer than investments in other assets like equity.
            </span>
            <span class="block-info__text mb-10">
                You can open a Fixed Deposit Account with our bank even in case you do not have a savings account.
                However, you will need to complete know-your-customer (KYC) set of documents as it is a usual procedure
                within the framework of Euro Deniz IBU Security Policies.
            </span>
            <span class="block-info__text mb-10">
                The minimum amount needed to open a fixed deposit account is negotiable. However, there is no limit on
                the maximum amount which a customer invests. In order to define the limits, please revert to your
                personal manager.
            </span>
            <span class="block-info__text mb-10">
                The customer is able to negotiate the Fixed Deposit terms with the personal manager. Usually a customer
                invests in Fixed Deposit for the period from 3 to 10 years. The deposit tenure can be chosen at your
                preference. Please consult your personal manager.
            </span>
            <span class="block-info__text mb-10">
                Fixed Deposit maturity date could be broken in case of urgent conditions. A penalty may be levied by the
                bank on premature withdrawals. The penalty amount is variable.
            </span>
